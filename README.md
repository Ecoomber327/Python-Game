# Python-Game
This is a game made using Python. Balls fall, and the user controls a ball at the bottom of the screen. The score is recorded as the number of balls dropped that the user dodges. When the ball the user is controlling collides with the ball the balls falling, the game automatically provides the score to the user.

The files, I have written are Game.py and physics_objects.py

Game.py is the code that organizes the game.

The others have been provided to me.
